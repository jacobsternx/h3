CLI Installing Chrome
Fedora now comes with the Google Chrome repository. But, the repository is disabled by default. So, you will need to enable the Google Chrome repository to install it on your system.
$ sudo sed -i 's/enabled=0/enabled=1/' /etc/yum.repos.d/google-chrome.repo
Install Google Chrome on Fedora 35
$ sudo dnf install -y google-chrome-stable
