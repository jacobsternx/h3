git config -l
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "."
git push -u origin main
git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -d -f
Makes working directory and stage match the most recent commit (also called HEAD), effectively obliterating all tracked uncommitted changes. 
To remove untracked files, you have to use the git clean command. 

:: Generate a Personal Access Token:
Log into GitHub
Click on your name / Avatar in the upper right corner and select Settings
On the left, click Developer settings
Select Personal access tokens and click Generate new token
Give the token a description/name and select the scope of the token
Selected repo for pull, push, clone, and commit actions, and admin:repo_hook
Click Generate token
Copy the token – this is your new password!

:: Configure Credential Caching
https://techexpertise.medium.com/storing-git-credentials-with-git-credential-helper-33d22a6b5ce7
git config --global credential.helper store
The .git-credentials file stores token in plain text. Each credential is stored on its a line as a URL
git config -l
If needed, you can later clear the token from the local computer by running
git config --global --unset credential.helper

:: Configure local
Once we have a token, we need to configure the local GIT client with a username and email address. 
https://www.edgoad.com/2021/02/using-personal-access-tokens-with-git-and-github.html
git config --global user.name "jacobsternx"
git config --global user.email ***********@gmail.com

:: Using Personal Access Tokens
When starting a new repo, the first REMOTE command should be git remote add origin git@github.com:username, if you run git remote set-url origin git@abc.com:mygit you will get error message: No such remote 'origin'.
git remote add origin git@github.com:jacobsternx
git remote set-url origin https://jacobsternx:<token-value>@github.com/jacobsternx/h3.git
git config -l

:: Clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/jacobsternx/h3.git (do this from /git)

:: Basic Git Operations
git add -A stages all changes no matter where executed whether it be the subdirectory or the parent directory.
git add -u stages modifications and deletions, without new files
git add . stages new files and modifications, without deletions (on the current directory).
git commit -m "commit message"
git-secrets scans commits, commit messages, and --no-ff merges to prevent adding secrets into your git repositories. If a commit, commit message, or any commit in a --no-ff merge history matches one of your configured prohibited regular expression patterns, then the commit is rejected.

git push origin head -u 
If you are on any branch, this creates the branch of same name on the remote. 
git config --global push.default current (then: git push, changes config)
Always push a local branch to upstream. Default as usually no harm creating new branches upstream
git branch 

First use git pull origin your_branch_name Then use git push origin your_branch_name
git pull --rebase git_url(Ex: https://github.com/username/reponame.git)
git push origin main
If it shows any fatal error regarding upstream after any future push then simply run:
git push --set-upstream origin main

:: Block command line pushes that expose my email: Solve it by modifying Git email
   75816278+jacobsternx@users.noreply.github.com
1. View current global user email: git config — global user.email
2. Find GitHub recommended email: in setting Email –> Email under keep my email private 
3. Reset global user email: git config --global user.email "75816278+jacobsternx@users.noreply.github.com"
4. Reset last submitted author information git commit --amend --reset-author
5. Resubmit git push --no-edit to avoid the editor
(For GPG key use Seahorse)

:: Advanced Git Operations
git log shows commits, <SHA> is a git commit ID and git log --stat shows stats about file names and line changes.
git revert <SHA> Creates a new commit that’s the opposite (or inverse) of the given SHA
git commit --amend or git commit --amend -m "commit message"
Will update and replace the most recent commit with a new commit that combines any staged changes with the contents of the previous commit. With nothing currently staged, this just rewrites the previous commit message.
git rebase -i <SHA> 
merge
reword
rebase
fixup
squash
pick
autosquash

:: To add files on specific branch ::
To create custom branch
  git branch branchname
To switch into custom branch
  git checkout branchname
To initialize in the custom branch
  git init
To add files in the custom branch
  git add file name
To commit the changes made in the custom branch
  git commit -m "your message"
To make changes in your GitHub repo
  git push

:: Git SSH Private/Public key pair 
Check if you already have a SSH keypair generated. Do the following:
$ ls -la ~/.ssh/id_rsa*
If the files exist, you already have SSH installed. IMPORTANT: But if you wish to regenerate the SSH key pair, at least back up your old SSH keys.
$ cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.old  # Make a copy of the old SSH private key
$ cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.old  # Make a copy of the old SSH public key
BE CAREFUL when using your ~/.ssh/id_rsa file. This is your private key, guard it properly.
