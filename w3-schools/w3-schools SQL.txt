Introduction to SQL

:: SQL is a Standard - BUT....

Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.

However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

:: RDBMS

Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.

A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table. 

A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.
